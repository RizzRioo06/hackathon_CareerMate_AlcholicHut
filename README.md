## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to generate mock interview"**
   - Check your API key is valid and has sufficient credits
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly
   - Ensure your AI provider is properly configured

2. **Frontend can't connect to backend**
   - Ensure backend is running on port 5000
   - Check CORS configuration
   - Verify Next.js rewrites are working

3. **Azure OpenAI "Resource not found"**
   - Verify deployment name is correct
   - Check API version matches your deployment
   - Ensure endpoint URL is correct

4. **Build errors**
   - Clear `.next` folder: `rm -rf .next`
   - Reinstall dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

### Debug Mode
All responses are generated by AI APIs. For testing without API calls, you can temporarily modify the backend code to return placeholder responses.
