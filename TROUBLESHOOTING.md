# Troubleshooting Delete Button Issue

## Problem
The delete button in the Dashboard component is not working.

## Root Cause
The backend was missing delete endpoints for:
- Career Guidance sessions
- Mock Interviews  
- Job Suggestions

## Solution Applied
1. **Added missing delete endpoints** in `backend/server.js`:
   - `DELETE /api/career-guidance/:id`
   - `DELETE /api/mock-interviews/:id`
   - `DELETE /api/job-suggestions/:id`

2. **Enhanced error handling** in the frontend delete function with better logging and user feedback.

3. **Added configuration file** to handle different backend URLs for development and production.

## Testing the Fix

### Option 1: Test with Local Backend
1. Start the backend server locally:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. The frontend will automatically use `http://localhost:5000/api` in development mode.

### Option 2: Test with Deployed Backend
1. Ensure your Render.com backend is running and accessible.
2. The frontend will use the production URL: `https://careermate-backend-nzb0.onrender.com/api`

### Option 3: Manual Testing
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Try deleting an item from the dashboard
3. Check console logs for detailed information about the delete request

## Debug Information
The delete function now includes:
- Console logging of the delete attempt
- Response status logging
- Error messages for failed deletions
- User alerts for better feedback

## Common Issues
1. **Backend not running**: Check if backend server is accessible
2. **CORS issues**: Ensure backend CORS is properly configured
3. **Database connection**: Verify MongoDB connection in backend
4. **Network issues**: Check if the backend URL is accessible

## Next Steps
If the delete button still doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify backend server is running
3. Test backend endpoints directly (e.g., with Postman)
4. Check network tab in browser dev tools for failed requests
